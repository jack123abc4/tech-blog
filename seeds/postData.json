So when I discovered Handlebars JS, a template language compatible with Javascript, and found that it uses a mustache as it's logo, I was outraged. A thick, beefy 'stache is a core symbol of masculinity in modern America and I was disgusted to learn that Handlebars JS is forcing digital bristles into the faces of developers all across the country. Please check back in the future for a link to the petition to take down Handlebars. Burn The Stache!"
